# Grades2Date - Grade and GPA Calculator 
Created by Cyruss Allen Amante - Dec 2022

## About
Grades2Date is a Grade and GPA Calculator application side project created by Cyruss Allen Amante that allows for a quick and easy calculation of one’s grades with only a couple of inputs. 

As data is received from the user, the calculator can calculate their current grade/GPA and total weightings; given that enough data is inputted by the user.

The program also allows for the creation of multiple data inputs of the calculator that can be used to separate different courses that the user may take. In the event that multiple courses are created using the calculator, the main page of the program will display the user’s final GPA for the year and can be calculated with both the four-point or the twelve-point gpa scale, depending on the user’s preference. 

The user may decide to export and save the data, in which the program will allow for easy exports in the .txt file type - a common file extension universally recognized by all word processors and text editors. In the near future we hope to implement the import and export of data to .csv file types, which is used for Microsoft Excel and various spreadsheet applications. 

If a user would like to open and edit the data, the program has the ability to open and read the .txt file types. This ultimately enables the user to create an unlimited number of profiles to calculate grades, creating easy file organization for each profile created.

## Creation
The program was mainly created using the programming language Python and the Tkinter GUI. 

## Licensing
Feel free to utilize the program and its code for your own use! All that I ask is that you give credit if you are using this for your own project.
